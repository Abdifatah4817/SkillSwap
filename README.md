Helping people connect, share what they’re good at, learn new things, and build a stronger community together. No cash needed—just skills and kindness!

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Many people have skills or knowledge they’d like to share, but don’t know how to find others who want to exchange with them. This leads to missed opportunities for learning and collaboration in communities.
